# Vulnerability Scanner Tool

This project is an automated vulnerability scanning tool designed to detect vulnerabilities in web applications, networks, and software. It generates detailed reports with suggested remediation steps.

## Overview

This tool integrates multiple scanning techniques to provide a comprehensive vulnerability assessment. While it combines different scanners, it's more accurately described as a tool rather than a full framework, as it doesn't provide an extensive API for building custom scanners.

## Features

- Web application scanning using Nikto and SQLMap
- Network scanning using Nmap
- Software version checking against known vulnerabilities
- Comprehensive JSON report generation

## Environment

This tool is designed to run on Kali Linux, which comes pre-installed with many of the required dependencies. It may work on other Linux distributions with the necessary tools installed, but Kali Linux is the recommended and tested environment.

## Prerequisites

- Kali Linux (preferred operating system)
- Python 3.x
- Nmap
- Nikto
- SQLMap

These tools come pre-installed on Kali Linux. If you're using a different distribution, ensure these are installed.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vulnerability-scanner.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd vulnerability-scanner
   ```
   

## Usage

Run the main script with the following syntax:

```
python main.py <target> --type <scan_type>
```

Where:
- `<target>` is the URL or IP address you want to scan
- `<scan_type>` can be one of: web, network, or software

Examples:

1. For a web scan:
   ```
   python main.py https://example.com -type web
   ```

2. For a network scan:
   ```
   python main.py 192.168.1.1 -type network
   ```

3. For a software scan:
   ```
   python main.py localhost -type software
   ```

4. To run all scan types:
   ```
   python main.py https://example.com -type all
   ```

The tool will execute the specified scan(s) and generate a JSON report with the results.

Note: Ensure you have permission to scan the target before running the tool.
